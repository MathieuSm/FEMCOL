# FEMCOL
Repository used for the Msc thesis investigating the collagen tensile properties of the ageing human proximal femur. This repo aims to facilitate collaborations between coworker of the project.

A conda virtual environment is used to allow every user to get identical results and facilitate internal script sharing.

First, install Anaconda using the instructions of:\
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html

Once done, you can go in the directory where the file "FEMCOL.yml" is stored and create a new virtual environment using:\
conda env create -f FEMCOL.yml

After the installation, the virtual environment can be activated using:\
conda activate FEMCOL
